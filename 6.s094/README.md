# 6s.094 Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars

These files represent three iterations on the self-driving challenge project. The goal (if I recall) was to reach a sustained speed of 80mph. I reached a sustained speed of 69.8mph.

Not quite state of the art, to be sure, but still a respectable highway speed.

It would be interesting to apply a more modern model to this problem.
